I was asked to reraete a webpage. I used HTML and CSS to create a webpage that looks 
smiliar to the webpage we had to recreate. I started with my HTML page to get the layout the way I wanted it to look. Then I used the CSS sheet to put in differnt styles. On the HTML I used tags like header, section, and footer to create the lay out i though it was best to use. also use elements like div class, img class, ul class to help id things that i want to be able to move around in the CSS sheet.
In the CSS sheet I was able to put in differnt font colors, background colors and margins to position images where i want them to be. Using differnt tags and class to get words on top of pictures.
